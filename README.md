# Credit Crunch

Several customers have noticed some suspicious activity on their banking accounts and notified the bank about it. The bank is now investigating the accounts to verify the transactions and to any detect fraud. Is there any suspicious activity on the accounts?

**Features**
- Jupyter notebook to create an interactive report
- Charts to visualize patterns
- A module of utility functions for processing data

## Instructions

Your task is to process the data to produce a report. In the data folder is a JSON file with customer transaction data. 

The final report should include:

- A bar chart comparing transaction amounts for all account
- A bar chart comparing most common location for all accounts
- Your analysis on any unusual activity
- A table of the total count of unusual transactions for each account


### Getting Started (optional)

Processing data is a very common task in most modern jobs. Analysts and scientists, however, must also visualize their data. 

But data processing is a meticulous task even in the best of times! You need to create utility functions to make your process more efficient.

Start by creating a suite of utility functions. These functions should process the data you need to build a chart. Your Notebook should import your modules and display the charts, only. **There should be no data processing or logic contained in your Notebook.**

The things you've learned so far still apply:

1. Setup your environment
1. Initialize the program
1. Build the main program


### Additional Challenges (optional)

A list of features or tasks learners can complete for more practice or for more challenge.

- Mask all sensitive data
